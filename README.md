Abstract:
In the realm of industrial machinery, the ability to predict and prevent failures is paramount to ensuring optimal performance and minimizing downtime. This study explores the application of machine learning techniques in developing a Predictive Maintenance Model for anticipating the failure of a machining tool tip. The focus lies in utilizing experimental data collected from a milling machine to train and evaluate various machine learning algorithms, with a keen emphasis on distinguishing between different modes of failure. The experimental data employed in this research originates from a milling machine, capturing a comprehensive set of features related to tool wear, cutting parameters, and environmental conditions. The dataset encompasses instances of normal operation as well as various failure scenarios, providing a robust foundation for training and validating predictive models. Several machine learning algorithms were employed to discern distinct failure modes, including Light Gradient Boosting, CatBoost Classifier, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The choice of algorithms was motivated by their proven efficacy in handling complex, non-linear relationships within data, a characteristic often inherent in machining processes. The results of the predictive maintenance model showcase the efficacy of employing machine learning in this context. Notably, Light Gradient Boosting, CatBoost Classifier, and Random Forest exhibited commendable performance, with accuracy and recall scores reflective of their ability to correctly identify instances of tool tip failure. However, Extreme Gradient Boosting emerged as the frontrunner, showcasing superior precision while maintaining competitive accuracy and recall values.
